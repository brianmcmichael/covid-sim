People should be able to inspect the original code behind the [paper](Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf) that is responsible for the unprecidented lockdowns globally. The code has since been heavily altered from the original upload. The following links are for those who wish to view this repository without the post-publication edits.
